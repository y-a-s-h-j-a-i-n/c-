SET-4: Q2, Q5, Q6

Q2: The given code has a base class charInput, it has member methods add() and getvalue(). The class
numInput inherits charInput. You need to implement:
add(): it should be inside charInput, this adds the given character to the current value
getValue(): it should be inside numInput, it returns the current value
add(): it should be inside numInput, this must override the base class method so that each
non-numeric char is ignored.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;
class charInput{
public:
void add(char c) { }
std::string getValue() { return NULL; }
};
class numInput : public charInput { };
int main(){
charInput* inputC = new charInput();
numInput* inputN = new numInput();
input-&gt;add(&#39;1&#39;);
input-&gt;add(&#39;a&#39;);
input-&gt;add(&#39;0&#39;);
cout &lt;&lt; input-&gt;getValue();
// the output should be 10
}

Q5: There are p white balls and q red balls, you need to put them into r bags such that:
No bag should be empty
A bag can contain only red balls or white balls, not both
No red ball can be left alone in a bag
Find the number of ways to put the balls in bags. All bags are identical, but each ball is unique (or
numbered).
Since the total number can be very large for larger values of p and q, you can take modulo 99,999,999
Ex: White balls: 2, red balls: 1, bags: 4. Answer: 0
White balls: 2, red balls: 4, bags: 4. Answer: 3


Q6: The grade of a student can be based on the following criteria:
Attendance must be more than 50%
Tests scores must be more than .70
Total score must be more than 5600 (just go with this number)
The grades are awarded as follows:
Grade is 10: if all conditions are met
Grade is 9: if conditions 1 and 2 are met
Grade is 8: if conditions 3 and 3 are met
Grade is 7: if conditions 1 and 3 are met
Grade is 6: if only one condition is met
Grade is 5: if none of the conditions are met
Write a cpp program to display the grades, based on the scores students secured in individual criteria.
Ex: input 53, 0.6, 5602 res: 10
Input 45, 0, 4500 res: 6
